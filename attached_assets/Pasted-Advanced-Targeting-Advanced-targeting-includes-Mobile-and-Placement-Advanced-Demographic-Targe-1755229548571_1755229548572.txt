Reach People Interested in Selected Cities and Regions
This feature expands upon our existing location targeting feature, by enabling advertisers to reach people who have shown intent to travel to, make purchases in, or general interest in the cities and regions you've selected, within the same country.

To opt in, set the geo parameter under individual_setting in targeting_automation to 1.
To opt out, set the geo parameter under individual_setting in targeting_automation to 0.

  },
  "targeting_automation": {

Enable Age and Gender Suggestions
Currently, this feature is available to select advertisers but will gradually roll out to all advertisers in the coming months.

To use age or gender as suggestions, simply configure the individual_setting parameter in the targeting_automation field. This setting will also be returned when retrieving the ad set, if it exists for the adset.

Limitations
This feature is only available for the OUTCOME_SALES and APP_INSTALLS objectives.
When using age and gender suggestions, ads will be shown beyond these settings when it's likely to improve performance of the ads.
Age as a suggestion
Set the age parameter under individual_setting in targeting_automation to 1. Then, include the age_range field in your audience specification.

Example request
{
  "geo_locations": {
    "countries": [
      "US"
    ]
  },
  "age_min": 18,
  "age_range": [25, 35],
  "targeting_automation": {
    "individual_setting": {
      "age": 1
    }
  }
}
Gender as a suggestion
Set the gender parameter under individual_setting in targeting_automation to 1.

Example request
